## Project Scale
- **Scenarios**: 12 complex evacuation scenarios for magnitude 6.7 earthquake
- **Data Volume**: 7.9 million daily trips processing
- **Tools**: CUBE macroscopic/mesoscopic analysis with USGS ShakeCast integration

## Technical Innovation
- Integration of heterogeneous data sources (survey, census, geological)
- Dynamic Traffic Assignment implementation
- GIS heat map generation for bottleneck identification

## Results
- Validated evacuation route recommendations for mobile application
- Quantified network degradation using delay, speed, and LOS metrics
- Led multi-stakeholder tabletop exercise for inter-agency coordination
