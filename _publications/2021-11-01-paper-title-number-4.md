excerpt: "This paper investigates factors influencing evacuee route choice between freeways and non-freeways during hurricane evacuations. Using survey data from Virginia's Hampton Roads region, a mixed logit model identifies key factors affecting this decision. Results show factors like willingness to follow official recommendations, housing type, expected travel time, employment status, and prior evacuation experience positively impact freeway route selection. Conversely, factors like timing of evacuation and destination type have negative effects. These findings can inform emergency and transportation agencies in developing effective evacuation plans during hurricanes."

Abstract: This paper investigates factors influencing evacuee route choice between freeways and non-freeways during hurricane evacuations. Using survey data from Virginia's Hampton Roads region, a mixed logit model identifies key factors affecting this decision. Results show factors like willingness to follow official recommendations, housing type, expected travel time, employment status, and prior evacuation experience positively impact freeway route selection. Conversely, factors like timing of evacuation and destination type have negative effects. These findings can inform emergency and transportation agencies in developing effective evacuation plans during hurricanes.
