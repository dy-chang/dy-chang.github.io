excerpt: "This study developed an immersive training module for transportation agency staff inspecting flagger operations in road work zones. The training aimed to provide a realistic experience using virtual reality, replicating current traffic control protocols. It involved creating virtual environments and human flagger avatars using motion capture technology. The module was well-received by state Department of Transportation staff, who appreciated the immersive experience lacking in traditional training methods."

Abstract: Add your abstract here.

This study developed an immersive training module for transportation agency staff inspecting flagger operations in road work zones. The training aimed to provide a realistic experience using virtual reality, replicating current traffic control protocols. It involved creating virtual environments and human flagger avatars using motion capture technology. The module was well-received by state Department of Transportation staff, who appreciated the immersive experience lacking in traditional training methods.
