title: "Commuter's dependence on expressways when travelling to work"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'The study focused on understanding why commuters in the Seoul metropolitan area continue to use expressways despite experiencing frequent traffic congestion. It employed a binary logit choice model to investigate the impact of commuters' behavioral and attitudinal tendencies on their choice of commute routes, alongside route- and individual-specific variables. The study involved survey participants who provided information about their commuting routes. Results indicated that factors beyond travel times and costs influenced commuters' reliance on expressways.'
