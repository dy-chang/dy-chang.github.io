excerpt: " The paper explores the potential use of virtual reality tools for training engineers who inspect work zones. It shares findings from a research project that developed an interactive and immersive training platform for state Department of Transportation (DOT) staff. Virtual reality offers a safer, cheaper, and quicker alternative to field visits, closely replicating the experience of driving through a work zone. The training platform consists of a learning module based on historical knowledge and an immersive module that provides a realistic experience of navigating through a work zone. Testing with 34 individuals from the Missouri Department of Transportation showed that 97% found virtual reality to be a realistic and effective training method for inspectors."

Abstract: 
The paper explores the potential use of virtual reality tools for training engineers who inspect work zones. It shares findings from a research project that developed an interactive and immersive training platform for state Department of Transportation (DOT) staff. Virtual reality offers a safer, cheaper, and quicker alternative to field visits, closely replicating the experience of driving through a work zone. The training platform consists of a learning module based on historical knowledge and an immersive module that provides a realistic experience of navigating through a work zone. Testing with 34 individuals from the Missouri Department of Transportation showed that 97% found virtual reality to be a realistic and effective training method for inspectors.
