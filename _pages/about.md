# Welcome to My Portfolio

I am a **Transportation Engineer** with expertise in traffic simulation, disaster response modeling, and VR technology applications. Currently serving as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Morgan State University's SMARTER Center, I specialize in analyzing complex transportation systems and developing innovative solutions for real-world challenges.

## Research Focus

My research centers on three key areas:

### ðŸš— Traffic Simulation & Modeling
- Advanced microsimulation using VISSIM, DynusT, and CUBE
- Large-scale evacuation modeling with 7.9 million daily trip analysis
- Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) implementation

### ðŸŒŠ Disaster Response & Resilience
- Post-disaster transportation impact assessment
- Regional traffic performance evaluation using real-time data
- Emergency evacuation planning and optimization

### ðŸ¥½ VR/AR Technology in Transportation
- Immersive work zone inspection training systems
- Unity 3D-based VR driving simulators
- Integration of motion capture with transportation safety protocols

## Current Projects

**Francis Scott Key Bridge Collapse Analysis** - Leading comprehensive regional impact assessment using Iteris ClearGuide data and advanced GIS mapping to evaluate mobility and congestion patterns.

**Transportation Resilience Research** - Developing methodologies to assess short and medium-term impacts of infrastructure failures on critical facility accessibility.
