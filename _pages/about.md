# Transportation Data Scientist and Modeler

I develop quantitative models that support transportation planning, resilience analysis, and evidence-based public decision-making.

My work focuses on understanding how transportation systems perform under disruption, uncertainty, and large-scale change. I specialize in evacuation modeling, dynamic traffic assignment (DTA), and data-driven system performance analysis, integrating simulation, econometrics, and interpretable machine learning.

During my Ph.D. and postdoctoral research in the United States, I have examined disaster evacuation dynamics, infrastructure disruption impacts, and corridor-level heterogeneity using scenario-based simulation, panel econometric methods, and predictive modeling. My work emphasizes translating complex analytical results into clear, decision-ready insights for transportation agencies.

Earlier in my career, I led the travel demand modeling and traffic assignment components of national-level feasibility studies, including O/D matrix refinement, network modification, calibration against observed traffic counts, and demand-based inputs for benefit–cost evaluation. This foundation in large-scale demand modeling informs my current resilience and systems-oriented research.

## Research Focus

Recent research examines how transportation systems respond to disruption and uncertainty, combining dynamic simulation, econometric analysis, and interpretable machine learning to support resilience-oriented planning and public-sector investment decisions.
